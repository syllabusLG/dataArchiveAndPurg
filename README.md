Below is a Python script that automates the archiving of Oracle tables within a schema. The script connects to the Oracle database, identifies tables in the schema, and moves data from each table to corresponding archive tables based on a condition. You’ll need the cx_Oracle library to interact with the Oracle database.

##Prerequisites

	1.	Install the cx_Oracle library:
        •       pip install cx_Oracle
	2.	Make sure the Oracle Instant Client is installed and configured properly:

##Script explanation

	1.	Database Connection:

	•	The get_connection() function establishes a connection to the Oracle database using cx_Oracle.

	2.	Archive Table Creation:

	•	The create_archive_table() function creates an archive table with the same structure as the original table if it doesn’t already exist.

	3.	Data Archiving:

	•	The archive_table_data() function moves data from the original table to the archive table based on the specified condition (e.g., creation_date < SYSDATE - 365).

	4.	Schema Iteration:

	•	The archive_schema_tables() function retrieves all user tables in the schema and processes each table for archiving.

	5.	Archiving Condition:

	•	Replace archiving_condition with your condition for determining which records to archive (e.g., records older than 1 year).
